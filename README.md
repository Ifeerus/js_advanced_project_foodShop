# FoodShop_advancedJS
In this project, I learned how to use JS on a real project.
I also studied it in depth, as well as wrote my variants of some frequently used functions of websites in vanilla JS :
1. Modals
2. Froms
3. Calculators
4. Sliders
5. Tabs

Also I have worked with local server, like GETTING and POSTING data.
